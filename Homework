What is JSX ?

JSX is not javascrit xml , it is not html inside javascript ,its an html like code . Initially we had to use React.createElement() 
everytime we wanted to create an element but in the case of large nested html elements its becomes a problem so to get rid of that we use
JSX.

Role of type attribute in script tag ? What options can I use there ?
The type attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies the content between the
<script> and </script> tags.

Actually what happens is that our starting point is index.html and there in script tag we gave link to App.js which has 
import commands and our browser does not understand import command so we have to tell the browser that its not simple app.js
file instead it is a javascript file that uses node_module files shuch as react and react-dom
